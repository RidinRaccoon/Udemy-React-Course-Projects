<h2> New Course Content [23 October 2023] </h2>

<h3> #1 - React Essentials (Demo Project) </h3>
<strong>Folder:</strong> [src > #1_Course_Content > #1-React_Essentials-Demo_Project]
<br><br>
<p>Instructional project to get a better grasp of the core concepts of React development (components, jsx, props, state).</p>
<p>This app renders a list that defines the main react concepts and a menu that toggles examples for each concept.</p>
<p>The information listed (Core concepts and examples) can be changed in the [data.tsx] file in the assets folder</p>


<br><br>
<h3> #2 - Tic-Tac-Toe </h3>
<strong>Folder:</strong> [src > #1_Course_Content > #2-Tic-Tac-Toe]
<br><br>
<p>Playable Tic-Tac-Toe game created to learn better design patterns and key concepts like managing and lifing the state, calculate values from state, etc.</p>
<p>Mostly an instructional project but since it's a simple design and I already knew most of the concepts I tried to develop the features by myself, checking afterwards if they match the solutions provided and making adjustments to improve the code.</p>

<br><br>
<h3> #3 - Investment Calculator </h3>
<strong>Folder:</strong> [src > #1_Course_Content > #2-Investment_Calculator]
<br><br>
<p>Allows the user to set investment information (yearly contribution, duration, expected returns, etc.) and calculates the investment results.</p>
<p>The results are displayed in a table where each row corresponds to the yearly data of the investment</p>
<p><i>NOTE: </i> Unlike the calculator from the old course content this one automatically shows the results without using a button to submit the inputs.</p>
